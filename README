SYNOPSIS:
    ./sifas_card_downloader [OPTIONS...]


DESCRIPTION:
    The program automatically downloads and categorizes cards from the game Love Live! School Idol Festival ALL STARS.
    Images are downloaded from https://idol.st/.


USAGE:

    either --all or --update, --download, and --organize. Optionally you can use --stills to
    download stills instead of cards.
